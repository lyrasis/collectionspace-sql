== Relationships between #{CSID} and #{a record type}

SELECT * FROM public.relations_common

== Count # of records having combination of 2 fields

[source,sql]
----
select count(sa.state_active), sa.state_active from
(SELECT CONCAT(misc.lifecyclestate, '/', rel.active) as state_active FROM public.relations_common rel

----

== CSID of one collectionobject with duplicate object number

Outputs rectype/csid format for use with collectionspace-migration-tools' `csid delete` command.

If there are THREE objects with the same object number value, this is only going to give you the CSID for one of them, so you'll still have two objects with the same object number value after running this through `csid delete`.
