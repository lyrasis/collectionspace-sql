== Find duplicate vocabulary terms

Duplicate vocabulary terms = the same display name value in the same vocabulary.

This is necessary since, prior to 8.1, it was possible to add the same term to a vocabulary, and this sometimes happened by accident during upgrades or when a vocabulary previously only in an inheriting profile was added to an inherited profile. E.g. custom profile inheriting from anthro defined descriptionLevels vocabulary; later a descriptionLevels vocabulary is added to anthro and inherited on top of the existing custom vocabulary.
