== Custom report for hosted client, involving combination of object and acquisition data

Also involves representation of authority hierarchy (broader classes for terms used in objects).

Requires https://github.com/lyrasis/collectionspace-sql/blob/main/functions.adoc#deurn[deurn function] to be run prior to running the query.
