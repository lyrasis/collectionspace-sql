== Custom report for hosted client

This is a custom report for a hosted client. It produces a list of object numbers for objects meeting their criteria:

* `descriptionlevel` = `collection` or `supporting collection`
* `responsibledepartment` starts with `archaeology`
* related to no other objects via a non-hierarchical ("affects") relationship
* has no non-collection or supporting collection child objects via hierarchical relationship
